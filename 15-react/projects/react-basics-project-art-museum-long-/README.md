Long Practice: Art Museum Project

1 user recently completed this Project
In this project, you will create React components to build a purely frontend application that displays a list of art galleries. Using the React Router library, you will enable a user to navigate through the different art galleries to see images and descriptions of their respective art pieces. The information about the art galleries will be seeded using data extracted from the Harvard Art Museum API.

By the end of the project, you should understand and be able to use the following React Router components and hook:

BrowserRouter
NavLink
Link
Route
Switch
useParams
You will also learn how to specify unique keys when creating arrays of JSX elements to render.
